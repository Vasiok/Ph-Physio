                        <h3>Physiotherapy</h3>
                        <h4>What is Physotherapy?</h4>
                        <p>Chartered Physiotherapists are health professionals allied to the medical profession and carry a minimum 4-year university degree. They use physical means of treatment such as joint manipulation/mobilisation techniques, exercise prescription and electrotherapy. Physiotherapy is heavily reliant on evidence-based research. It is a scientific approach, which aims to maximise mobility and quality of life using clinical diagnosis and appropriate treatment. </p>
                        <h4>What is a &#39;&#39;CHARTERED&#39;&#39; Physiotherapist?</h4>
                        <p>The title &#39;&#39;Physiotherapist&#39;&#39; alone is not evidence of a formal qualification in Physiotherapy. All Chartered Physiotherapists have completed a minimum four-year university degree and most also hold a masters. Members of the Irish Society of Chartered Physiotherapists are bound by a professional Code of Ethics and have access to extensive postgraduate education programmes. Check for the initials MISCP after the Physiotherapist&#39;s name. </p>

                        <h3>Acupuncture</h3>
                        <h4>How does it Work?</h4>
                        <p>Acupuncture is a technique based on Traditional Chinese Medicine which successfully treats pain through the insertion of needles at specific acupuncture points to balance the body&#39;s Chi.</p>

                        <p>Acupuncture is a safe, drug free intervention and painless procedure in which very fine needles are inserted at particular acupuncture points on the body to relieve the symptoms of various physical and psychological conditions, particularly for both acute injuries and chronic conditions resilient to other treatments.</p>
                        <h4>How We Can Help</h4>
                        <p>Our team of Acupuncturists and trained Chartered Physiotherapists asses your condition and goals of treatment in order to work out a treatment plan specific to you to ensure you get the most from each session with us. Depending on your needs, our team may suggest a combination of hands-on therapy and acupuncture or just pure acupuncture to treat you.</p>
                        <p>Our clinicians ensure your comfort and safety throughout, and carefully monitor progress throughout your sessions meaning you should feel a definite affect after a few sessions which reduces the need for prolonged treatment. Top up sessions may be recommended to maintain a pain free state. It is safe to have Acupuncture while having conventional medical treatment.</p>

                        <h3>Sports Injuries</h3>
                        <h4>What Is A Sports Injury?</h4>
                        <p>A sports injury can happen to anyone, at any time, for any reason. A sports injury can be traumatic or it can be an injury from overuse or repetitive strain during sports. Common sports injuries treated by our physios include knee pain and injuries, swollen muscles, sprains and strains, fractures and dislocations.
                        </p>
                        <p>A sports injury should not be ignored, it wont heal itself properly on its own and you may end up with more serious long term problems like stiffer joints, weaker muscles or tissue tightness. Therefore whether sports injuries are recent or old they need professional assessment and management in the form of Sports Physio to ensure no unnecessary complications arise.</p>
                        <h4>What We Offer</h4>
                        <p>Any Chartered Physiotherapist can treat a sports injury, but at The Physio Company we believe that &#39;just&#39; treating the condition is not enough. We want to identify the exact causes and other contributing factors to your injury so that we can  provide a more comprehensive treatment plan for you to bring you back to your sport  in a superior condition than before.</p>
                        <p>Our Physios can provide the most up to date treatment  for all types of sports injuries. It is important to note that Chartered Physiotherapists (and not any other profession) play a key role in the treatment, rehabilitation and injury prevention of professional athletes in sporting teams and organisations like the Irish Rugby and Soccer teams.</p>
                        <p>Your body is important, so choose carefully who you choose to treat it.</p>

                        <h3>Osteopathy</h3>
                        <h4>What is osteopathy?</h4>
                        <p>Osteopathy is a form of drug-free non-invasive manual medicine that focuses on total body health by treating and strengthening the musculoskeletal framework, which includes the joints, muscles and spine. Its aim is to positively affect the body's nervous, circulatory and lymphatic systems.</p>
                        <h4>What we Offer</h4>
                        <p>Osteopathy focuses on the diagnosis, management, treatment and prevention of musculoskeletal and other related disorders without the use of drugs or surgery.  Commonly treated conditions include back and neck pain, postural problems, sporting injuries, muscle and joint deterioration, restricted mobility and occupational ill&#45;health. </p>

                        <h3>Exercise Therapy</h3>
                        <h4>What is Exercise &amp; Movement?</h4>
                        <p>Exercise physiology is a branch of the biological sciences and is concerned with the way in which the body responds to exercise and training.</p>
                        <p>Exercises can be given to reduce pain and stiffness, to improve flexibility and strength, or simply to return to sport or activity after an injury or break.</p>
                        <h4>What We Offer </h4>
                        <p>Our Physios are trained to provide exercise and movement programmes that are individually tailored to each patient.</p>
                        <p>Our Physios not only advise you on how to exercise safely but also on what types of exercise are suitable for your age and condition. We understand that exercise is not always easy or thought o be fun for all our patients so we will make it as interesting and simple to include into your daily life as possible.</p>
                        <p>Exercise physiologists typically provide scientific support at various levels to athletes and teams within a single sport or several sports. This may involve monitoring training through the measurement and assessment of such physical functions as respiration, metabolism, body composition, muscle, nutrition, and the nervous, pulmonary and cardiovascular systems.</p>

                        <h3>Massage Therapy</h3>
                        <h4>What is a Massage?</h4>
                        <p>Chartered Physiotherapists understand the body better than most other therapists, giving them an advantage when it comes to treating your aches and pains. This means that as well as providing immediate relief through massage, physiotherapists can get to any underlying causes that may be contributing to your tension and pain.</p>
                        <p>So Physiotherapists don&#39;t just scrape the surface, they get to the root of the problem and work from there, which helps to prevent the same problem reoccurring.</p>
                        <h4>What We Offer</h4>
                        <p>Our Chartered Physiotherapists are trained in a variety of different massage therapies and techniques but in short, our massage therapy involves applying deep pressure on concentrated areas of tension and pain. Generally with muscle tension or an injury, there will be adhesions (areas of painful rigid tissue) in the muscle, ligament or tendon that cause pain and inflammation.</p>
                        <p>Our Physiotherapists have the necessary training and knowledge to get deeper into the muscle layers to break down these adhesions and restore normal muscle function as well as relieving pain. Saying that, we make sure the pressure applied is not overly uncomfortable as your comfort is important to us.</p>

                        <h3>Orthodics</h3>
                        <h4>What are Orthotics?</h4>
                        <p>Orthotics are temporary or customised orthopaedic insoles that fit easily and securely within your footwear.  Essentially these prescribed insoles will help to restore regular balance and pressure on muscles and joints, which allows you to get on with things pain free, whether that be in your sport, in work or just  in daily life.</p>
                        <p>Orthotics can assist with a wide range of biomechanical problems such as Heel pain, Flat feet, Shin splints, Fallen arches, Plantar Fasciitis, Knee pain, Back pain and much more.</p>
                        <p>Everybody has different requirements and so we can prescribe various types of shell strength and flex of the insoles. This helps to ensure that the orthotic is perfectly suited to you and your needs.</p>
                        <h4>What We Offer</h4>
                        <p>One of our Podiatrists or  Chartered Physiotherapist team will bio-mechanically assess you in order to determine whether orthotics would be of benefit. If our team think that this is the case, they will first provide you with temporary orthotics to wear for 1-2 months. The purpose of the temporary orthotics is to allow the Physio to make any necessary corrections which might benefit you during this time period.</p>
                        <p>If these temporary orthotics function as our Physio expects, then it is quite likely that you will be prescribed Custom-made orthotics. The methods used to make these orthotics are through a Foam Box or by taking a Dynamic Scan of your foot, based on your condition present, the sport you play or what your needs are. If the patient and the Physiotherapist both agree, the temporary orthotic stage may be bypassed, if this is deemed the best thing to do.

                        <h3>Dry Needling</h3>
                        <h4>What is Dry Needling?</h4>
                        <p>With Dry Needling, the needles are used to target the trigger point of the problem muscle, this is known as the myofascial trigger point and is often described as a muscle &#39;knot&#39; which contributes to muscle pain and dysfunction.</p>
                        <p>The needle is gently inserted into the skin directly at this point and often a local twitch response is experienced, this is a good sign and is what the physiotherapist is looking for. It means the trigger point has been stimulated, jump starting the muscle and nerve supply and increasing the blood flow to the area which helps to relax the muscle.  When this local twitch response occurs, a brief painful response might be felt but it won&#39;t last for more than a second.</p>
                        <p>After dry needling treatment, the area that was treated will feel much softer and relaxed and the person will feel looser.</p>
                        <h4>What We Offer</h4>
                        <p>One technique might be more appropriate than the other depending on your condition, so let us guide you on what would be the best option for you. We have Chartered Physiotherapists trained in either Dry Needling or Acupuncture. Both techniques can be performed on their own or can be combined with regular physio treatment.</p>
